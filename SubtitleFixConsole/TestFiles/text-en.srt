00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,159
The people in the back,
can you hear me clearly?

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,030
OK, good.

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,571
Have you ever held a question in mind

5
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:20,496
for so long that it becomes
part of how you think?

6
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:26,237
Maybe even part of who you are
as a person?

7
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,795
Well I've had a question in my mind 
for many, many years

8
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:33,876
and that is: 
How can you speed up learning?

9
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,085
Now, this is an interesting question

10
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,648
because if you speed up learning,

11
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,359
you can spend less time at school.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,970
And if you learn really fast,

13
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,119
you probably 
wouldn't have to go to school at all.

14
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:51,818
Now, when I was young, 
school was sort of OK but...

15
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:55,983
I found quite often that school 
got in the way of learning

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,859
so I had this question in mind: 
How do you learn faster?

17
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:03,523
And this began when I was 
very, very young,

18
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,821
when I was 11 years old,

19
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:08,497
I wrote a letter to researchers in the 
Soviet Union, asking about hypnopaedia,

20
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:12,882
this is sleep-learning,

21
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:14,922
where you get a tape recorder, 
you put it beside your bed

22
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:17,892
and it turns on 
in the middle of the night

23
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,006
when you're sleeping,

24
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,439
and you're supposed to be 
learning from this.

25
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,688
A good idea, 
unfortunately it doesn't work.

26
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:26,468
But, hypnopaedia did open the doors 
to research in other areas

27
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:30,783
and we've had 
incredible discoveries about

28
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,083
learning that began 
with that first question.

29
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:37,123
I went on from there to become 
passionate about psychology

30
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:40,293
and I have been involved in psychology
in many different ways

31
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,149
for the rest of my life 
up until this point.

32
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:46,968
In 1981, I took myself to China

33
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:50,985
and I decided that I was going to be 
native level in Chinese inside two years.

34
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:57,674
Now, you need to understand that 
in 1981, everybody thought

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,530
Chinese was really, really difficult

36
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,012
and that a Westerner 
could study for 10 years or more

37
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,494
and never really get very good at it.

38
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:09,977
And I also went in with a different idea

39
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,082
which was: taking all of the conclusions

40
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,633
from psychological research 
up to that point

41
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,184
and applying them 
to the learning process.

42
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:20,751
What was really cool was that in six 
months I was fluent in Mandarin Chinese

43
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,059
and it took a little bit longer 
to get up to native.

44
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,267
But I looked around and I saw all of 
these people from different countries

45
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,495
struggling terribly with Chinese,

46
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:36,677
I saw Chinese people struggling terribly 
to learn English and other languages,

47
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:41,338
and so my question got refined down to:

48
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,933
How can you help a normal adult

49
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:48,537
learn a new language 
quickly, easily and effectively?

50
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,261
Now this is a really, really important 
question in today's world.

51
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:55,427
We have massive challenges 
with environment,

52
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:57,618
we have massive challenges 
with social dislocation,

53
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:00,676
with wars, all sorts of things going on

54
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:03,075
and if we can't communicate,

55
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,639
we're really going to have difficulty 
solving these problems.

56
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,563
So we need to be able to speak 
each other's languages,

57
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:11,307
this is really, really important.

58
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,941
The question then is: How do you do that?

59
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,002
Well, it's actually really easy.

60
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:19,889
You look around for people 
who can already do it,

61
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:22,776
you look for situations 
where it's already working

62
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,663
and then you identify the principles
and apply them.

63
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:28,512
It's called modelling and I've been 
looking at language learning

64
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:31,576
and modelling language learning 
for about 15 to 20 years now.

65
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:36,568
And my conclusion, 
my observation from this is

66
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:39,282
that any adult can learn a second 
language to fluency inside six months.

67
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:44,926
Now when I say this, most people 
think I'm crazy, this is not possible.

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
So let me remind everybody of 
the history of human progress,

69
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:54,807
it's all about expanding our limits.

70
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,176
In 1950, everybody believed that running 
one mile in four minutes was impossible,

71
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:04,628
and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956

72
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,608
and from there 
it's got shorter and shorter.

73
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:10,038
100 years ago everybody believed that 
heavy stuff doesn't fly.

74
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:13,748
Except it does and we all know this.

75
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,481
How does heavy stuff fly?

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,070
We reorganise the material 
using principles that we have learned

77
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,269
from observing nature, birds in this case.

78
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,111
And today we've gone even further...

79
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:31,942
We've gone even further, 
so you can fly a car.

80
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,622
You can buy one of these 
for a couple 100.000 US dollars.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
We now have cars in the world that fly.

82
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:40,885
And there's a different way to fly 
which we've learned from squirrels.

83
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:44,553
So all you need to do is copy 
what a flying squirrel does,

84
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:47,349
build a suit called a wing suit and 
off you go, you can fly like a squirrel.

85
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:51,902
Now most people, a lot of people, 
I wouldn't say everybody

86
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,549
but a lot of people think they can't draw.

87
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,377
However there are some key principles, 
five principles, that you can apply

88
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
to learning to draw and you can 
actually learn to draw in five days.

89
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,168
So, if you draw like this, you learn 
these principles for five days

90
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,548
and apply them and after five days 
you can draw something like this.

91
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,259
Now I know this is true because 
that was my first drawing

92
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,142
and after five days of applying these 
principles that was what I was able to do.

93
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:23,143
And I looked at this and I went:

94
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,930
"Wow, so that's how I look like 
when I'm concentrating so intensely

95
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:28,571
that my brain is exploding."

96
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,199
So, anybody can learn to draw in five days

97
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,921
and in the same way, with the same logic,

98
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:38,967
anybody can learn a second language
in six months.

99
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,602
How? There are five principles
and seven actions.

100
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,309
There may be a few more 
but these are absolutely core.

101
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:50,539
And before I get into those 
I just want to talk about two myths,

102
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:54,164
I want to dispel two myths.

103
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,990
The first is that you need talent.

104
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:57,967
Let me tell you about Zoe.

105
00:05:58,955 --> 00:05:59,955
Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, 
was trying to learn Dutch,

106
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:04,506
struggling extremely, extremely... 
a great deal

107
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:07,758
and finally people were saying: 
"You're completely useless,"

108
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,336
"you're not talented," "give up," 
"you're a waste of time"

109
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,506
and she was very, very depressed.

110
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,074
And then she came across 
these five principles,

111
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,376
she moved to Brazil and she applied them

112
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:20,914
and in six months 
she was fluent in Portuguese,

113
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:23,605
so talent doesn't matter.

114
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:25,508
People also think that immersion in a new 
country is the way to learn a language.

115
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,722
But look around Hong Kong, 
look at all the westerners

116
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,308
who've been here for 10 years, 
who don't speak a word of Chinese.

117
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,587
Look at all the Chinese living in 
America, Britain, Australia, Canada

118
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:40,084
have been there 10, 20 years 
and they don't speak any English.

119
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Immersion per se does not work.

120
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:46,834
Why? Because a drowning man 
cannot learn to swim.

121
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:50,873
When you don't speak a language, 
you're like a baby.

122
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,474
And if you drop yourself into a context

123
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,459
which is all adults talking about stuff 
over your head, you won't learn.

124
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,032
So, what are the five principles 
that you need to pay attention to?

125
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:03,367
First: the four words,

126
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
attention, meaning, relevance and memory,

127
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,750
and these interconnect in very, 
very important ways.

128
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,214
Especially when you're talking 
about learning.

129
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,474
Come with me on a journey 
through a forest.

130
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:15,933
You go on a walk through a forest

131
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,306
and you see something like this... 
Little marks on a tree,

132
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:21,883
maybe you pay attention, maybe you don't.

133
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:24,957
You go another 50 metres 
and you see this...

134
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,267
You should be paying attention.

135
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,684
Another 50 metres, if you haven't been 
paying attention, you see this...

136
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,401
And at this point,
you're paying attention.

137
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,207
And you've just learned that this...
is important,

138
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,211
it's relevant 
because it means this,

139
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,837
and anything that is related, 
any information related to your survival

140
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,037
is stuff that you're going to pay
attention to

141
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:51,272
and therefore you're going
to remember it.

142
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,279
If it's related to your personal goals,

143
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,228
then you're going to pay attention to it.

144
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,270
If it's relevant, 
you're going to remember it.

145
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,930
So, the first rule, 
first principle for learning a language

146
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:02,756
is focus on language content 
that is relevant to you.

147
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,309
Which brings us to tools.

148
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,220
We master tools by using tools 
and we learn tools the fastest

149
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,299
when they are relevant to us.

150
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:15,484
So let me share a story.

151
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:16,757
A keyboard is a tool.

152
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:19,192
Typing Chinese a certain way, 
there are methods for this. That's a tool.

153
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:22,774
I had a colleague many years ago

154
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:25,988
who went to night school; 
Tuesday night, Thursday night,

155
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,651
two hours each time, practicing at home,

156
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:30,975
she spent nine months, 
and she did not learn to type Chinese.

157
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
And one night we had a crisis.

158
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:37,587
We had 48 hours to deliver 
a training manual in Chinese.

159
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:41,636
And she got the job, 
and I can guarantee you

160
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,731
in 48 hours, she learned to type Chinese

161
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:45,737
because it was relevant,
it was meaningful, it was important,

162
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:48,643
she was using a tool to create value.

163
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,156
So the second principle for learning 
a language is to use your language

164
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:54,547
as a tool to communicate 
right from day one.

165
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:58,688
As a kid does.

166
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:00,889
When I first arrived in China, 
I didn't speak a word of Chinese,

167
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,919
and on my second week, 
I got to take a train ride overnight.

168
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:08,948
I spent eight hours sitting 
in the dining car

169
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,141
talking to one of the guards on the train,

170
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:13,144
he took an interest in me for some reason,

171
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,219
and we just chatted all night in Chinese

172
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:18,063
and he was drawing pictures and 
making movements with his hands

173
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,079
and facial expressions 
and piece by piece by piece

174
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:23,786
I understood more and more.

175
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,409
But what was really cool, 
was two weeks later,

176
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:29,237
when people were talking Chinese 
around me,

177
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:31,643
I was understanding some of this

178
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,245
and I hadn't even made any effort 
to learn that.

179
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,366
What had happened, 
I'd absorbed it that night on the train,

180
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,183
which brings us to the third principle.

181
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,397
When you first understand the message,

182
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,584
then you will acquire 
the language unconsciously.

183
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:49,509
And this is really, 
really well documented now,

184
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,115
it's something called 
comprehensible input.

185
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,166
There's 20 or 30 years 
of research on this,

186
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,234
Stephen Krashen, a leader in the field,

187
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,164
has published all sorts of 
these different studies

188
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:00,844
and this is just from one of them.

189
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:02,661
The purple bars show the scores 
on different tests for language.

190
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:10,611
The purple people were people who had 
learned by grammar and formal study,

191
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,365
the green ones are the ones 
who learned by comprehensible input.

192
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,497
So, comprehension works. 
Comprehension is key

193
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,759
and language learning is not about 
accumulating lots of knowledge.

194
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:29,947
In many, many ways 
it's about physiological training.

195
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,159
A woman I know from Taiwan 
did great in English at school,

196
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:38,394
she got A grades all the way through,

197
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,159
went through college, A grades, 
went to the US

198
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,025
and found she couldn't understand 
what people were saying.

199
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,514
And people started asking her: 
"Are you deaf?"

200
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:50,405
And she was. English deaf.

201
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:53,815
Because we have filters 
in our brain that filter in

202
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,106
the sounds that we are familiar with

203
00:10:58,584 --> 00:10:59,584
and they filter out the sounds of 
languages that we're not.

204
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,633
And if you can't hear it, 
you won't understand it,

205
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,012
if you can't understand it, 
you're not going to learn it.

206
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:08,726
So you actually have to be 
able to hear these sounds.

207
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
And there are ways to do that 
but it's physiological training.

208
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,219
Speaking takes muscle.

209
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,312
You've got 43 muscles in your face,

210
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,215
you have to coordinate those in a way

211
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,708
that you make sounds that 
other people will understand.

212
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:28,455
If you've ever done a new sport 
for a couple of days,

213
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,630
and you know how your body feels? Hurts?

214
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:34,802
If your face is hurting, 
you're doing it right.

215
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:39,651
And the final principle is state. 
Psycho-physiological state.

216
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,204
If you're sad, angry, worried, upset, 
you're not going to learn. Period.

217
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,174
If you're happy, relaxed, 
in an Alpha brain state, curious,

218
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:52,824
you're going to learn really quickly,

219
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:54,863
and very specifically you need
to be tolerant of ambiguity.

220
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:58,513
If you're one of those people 
who needs to understand 100 percent

221
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:01,602
every word you're hearing, 
you will go nuts,

222
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,462
because you'll be incredibly upset 
all the time, because you're not perfect.

223
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,810
If you're comfortable with getting some, 
not getting some,

224
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,030
just paying attention 
to what you do understand,

225
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,333
you're going to be fine, relaxed,
and you'll be learning quickly.

226
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:17,852
So based on those five principles, 
what are the seven actions that you take?

227
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:22,128
Number one: Listen a lot.

228
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:24,647
I call it brain soaking.

229
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:27,198
You put yourself in a context

230
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,691
where you're hearing tons and tons 
and tons of a language

231
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:32,274
and it doesn't matter 
if you understand it or not.

232
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:34,785
You're listening to the rhythms, 
to patterns that repeat,

233
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:38,309
you're listening to things that stand out.

234
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:40,362
(Chinese) Pào nǎozi.

235
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,105
(English) So, just soak your brain in this.

236
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,611
The second action is that 
you get the meaning first,

237
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,530
even before you get the words.

238
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,469
You go: "Well how do I do that? 
I don't know the words!"

239
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,269
Well, you understand what these 
different postures mean.

240
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,267
Human communication is body language 
in many, many ways, so much body language.

241
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,192
From body language you can 
understand a lot of communication,

242
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,401
therefore, you're understanding, you're 
acquiring through comprehensible input.

243
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:08,693
And you can also use patterns 
that you already know.

244
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:12,844
If you're a Chinese speaker of Mandarin 
and Cantonese and you go to Vietnam,

245
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:17,643
you will understand 60 percent of what 
they say to you in daily conversation,

246
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:23,316
because Vietnamese is about 30 percent 
Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese.

247
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:29,964
The third action: Start mixing.

248
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:32,463
You probably have never thought of this

249
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,333
but if you've got 10 verbs, 
10 nouns and 10 adjectives,

250
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,068
you can say 1000 different things.

251
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:40,996
Language is a creative process.

252
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,279
What do babies do? OK, 
"me", "bath", "now".

253
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,620
OK, that's how they communicate.

254
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,245
So start mixing, get creative, 
have fun with it,

255
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:52,851
it doesn't have to be perfect, 
just has to work.

256
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,005
And when you're doing this, 
you focus on the core.

257
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,212
What does that mean?

258
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:00,827
Well, any language is 
high frequency content.

259
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:03,665
In English 1000 words covers 85 percent

260
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,370
of anything you're ever going 
to say in daily communication.

261
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,289
3000 words gives you 98 percent

262
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,015
of anything you're going to say
in daily conversation.

263
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:15,758
You got 3000 words, 
you're speaking the language.

264
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,489
The rest is icing on the cake.

265
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
And when you're just beginning 
with a new language,

266
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:23,951
start with your tool box. Week number one,

267
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:27,438
in your new language you say things like:

268
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,709
"How do you say that?"
"I don't understand,"

269
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:31,824
"repeat that please," 
"what does that mean?"

270
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:34,084
all in your target language.

271
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,650
You're using it as a tool, 
making it useful to you,

272
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:38,966
it's relevant to learn other things 
about the language.

273
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,093
By week two,
you should be saying things like:

274
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:44,954
"me," "this," "you," "that," 
"give," you know, "hot,"

275
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,654
simple pronouns, 
simple nouns, simple verbs,

276
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:52,804
simple adjectives, 
communicating like a baby.

277
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:55,324
And by the third or fourth week, 
you're getting into "glue words."

278
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,126
"Although," "but," "therefore," 
these are logical transformers

279
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,253
that tie bits of a language together, 
allowing you to make more complex meaning.

280
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,108
At that point you're talking.

281
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
And when you're doing that, 
you should get yourself a language parent.

282
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:16,703
If you look at how 
children and parents interact,

283
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:19,678
you'll understand what this means.

284
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:22,113
When a child is speaking, it'll be using 
simple words, simple combinations,

285
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,990
sometimes quite strange, 
sometimes very strange pronunciation,

286
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:29,658
other people from outside the family 
don't understand it.

287
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:33,828
But the parents do.

288
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:35,789
And so the kid has a safe environment, 
gets confidence.

289
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,201
The parents talk to the children 
with body language

290
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,039
and with simple language they 
know the child understands.

291
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:46,532
So you have a comprehensible input 
environment that's safe,

292
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,383
we know it works; otherwise none of you 
would speak your mother tongue.

293
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:53,842
So you get yourself a language parent,

294
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:55,699
who's somebody interested in you 
as a person

295
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:57,836
who will communicate with you 
essentially as an equal,

296
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:00,644
but pay attention to help you 
understand the message.

297
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:05,278
There are four rules of a language parent.

298
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:07,595
Spouses are not very good at this, OK?

299
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,734
But the four rules are,

300
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:10,894
first of all, they will work hard 
to understand what you mean

301
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:13,826
even when you're way off beat.

302
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,278
Secondly, they will never 
correct your mistakes.

303
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,710
Thirdly, they will feed back 
their understanding of what you are saying

304
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:23,383
so that you can respond appropriately 
and get that feedback

305
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,239
and then they will use 
words that you know.

306
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,863
The sixth thing you have to do, 
is copy the face.

307
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:34,188
You got to get the muscles working right,

308
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,270
so you can sound in a way that 
people will understand you.

309
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
There's a couple of things you do.

310
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:41,885
One is that you hear how it feels, 
and feel how it sounds

311
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:45,388
which means you have a feedback loop 
operating in your face,

312
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:48,577
but ideally if you can look at 
a native speaker

313
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:51,654
and just observe 
how they use their face,

314
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:53,671
let your unconscious mind 
absorb the rules,

315
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:56,536
then you're going to be 
able to pick it up.

316
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:58,931
And if you can't get a native speaker 
to look at, you can use stuff like this...

317
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,329
(Female voice) Sing, song, 
king, stung, hung.

318
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,475
(Chris Lonsdale) And the final idea here, 
the final action you need to take

319
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:17,064
is something that I call "direct connect".

320
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,204
What does this mean? Well most people 
learning a second language

321
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,369
sort of take the mother tongue words 
and the target words and go over them

322
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:25,923
again and again in their mind to try 
and remember them. Really inefficient.

323
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:29,918
What you need to do is realise that

324
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,144
everything you know is an image 
inside your mind, it's feelings,

325
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
if you talk about fire, 
you can smell the smoke,

326
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:37,736
you can hear the crackling, 
you can see the flames,

327
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,362
so what you do, is you go into 
that imagery and all of that memory

328
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:43,849
and you come out with another pathway. 
So I call it "same box, different path".

329
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:48,289
You come out of that pathway 
and you build it over time,

330
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,039
you become more and more skilled 
at just connecting the new sounds

331
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:54,668
to those images that you already have, 
into that internal representation.

332
00:17:58,798 --> 00:17:59,798
And over time you even become naturally 
good at that process,

333
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
that becomes unconscious.

334
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,582
So, there are five principles that you 
need to work with, seven actions,

335
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:09,374
if you do any of them, 
you're going to improve.

336
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:11,937
And remember these are things 
under your control as the learner.

337
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,021
Do them all and you're going to be 
fluent in a second language in six months.

338
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,963
Thank you.

339
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:20,352
(Applause)
